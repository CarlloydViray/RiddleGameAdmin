1. CHANGE DATABASE VALUES IN conn.php depending on your current database configuration
2. Create database named 'riddle'
3. Import riddle.sql inside riddle database
4. Only edit CSS to suit your preference (Back-end is properly coded based on the requirements, change back-end code on your own risk if you know what you're doing).
5. Code is not properly optimized and is made to look like a beginner non-professional group-work shite.
6. Code base can be used as BASIC reviewer. Goodluck!
